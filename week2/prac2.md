# Week: Week 2

This week, I have learned Joomla. Joomla is a very useful CMS tool for website creation. It provices numerous resources essential for building a website. Addtionally, Joomla requres XAMPP, an open-source cross-platform web server solution.
# Resources/Links
I watched YouTube turotials and searched for answers on forums, partucularly [Joomla's Official forum](https://forum.joomla.org).
# Estimated Hours:
Approximately 10 hours â€“ 2 to 4 hours per day.
# Content Insights:
I have used Joomla before, and although it was complex when I first learned it, now it felt a bit easier to use. I was also somewhat familiar with XAMPP, so setting up the necessary tools was not an issue. After spending time exploring Joomla more, I found it have more tools and enjoyable to create a website with it.
# Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
I enjoy learning through vides because they provice a visual, hands-on experience, allowing me to grasp concepts more quickly. I followed a parallel approach, watching tutorials while simultaneously applying what I learned in practice.

Overall, this week was an exiciting learning experience. I gained valuable insights, developed new skills, and had fun experimenting with Joomla.
